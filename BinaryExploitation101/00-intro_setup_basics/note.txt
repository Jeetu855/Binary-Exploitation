reading in data with gets

gets is hazardous, dosent do bounds check, so we can buffer overflow

char buffer[16]; so we can enter 16 chars and it wont overflow

32 bit file , dynamically linked, non stripped 
dynamically linked means in the program we have functions like 'printf' and 'gets', so rather than including the code for these functions in the main file, its simply going to look to the Libc library on the computer system its being run on.
not stripped means when we reverse it we will be able to see function names and other important things

# gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fstack-protector-all
this turns on the protection
#checksec --file vuln

to turn off the protections
#gcc vuln.c -o vuln -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -m32
